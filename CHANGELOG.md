Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Rewrite `README.zh-CN.md` into a newcomer-friendly Chinese guide with clearer quick start, runtime roles, maintenance flow, and FAQ.
- Rewrite `README.md` with matching English onboarding, clearer canonical-vs-derived asset guidance, and a simpler command reference.
- Expand both README files to restore key Meta_Kim design concepts: 8-stage spine vs. business workflow, hidden state skeleton, public-display gates, rollback protocol, and Evolution storage.
- Restore the original Mermaid flowcharts in both README files: method chain, 8-stage spine, iron-rules relation, and system flow.
- Rework `AGENTS.md` into a Codex-specific guide that keeps the dispatch-before-execution rule but removes cross-runtime ambiguity.
- Rework `CLAUDE.md` into a clearer Claude Code guide centered on canonical sources, hooks, and the `Task()`-based execution rule.
- Expand `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to restore capability-first dispatch, workflow-contract layering, hidden skeleton, and display-gate discipline.
- Normalize explanations for `deps:install`, `discover:global`, `probe:clis`, `eval:agents`, and `verify:all`.
- Strengthen the canonical governance sources to make agent ownership explicit: only pure `Q / Query` may bypass agents, every executable task must have an owner, capability gaps now resolve through existing owner / Type B creation / temporary fallback owner.
- Add protocol-first dispatch requirements across the canonical sources: `runHeader`, `dispatchBoard`, `workerTaskPacket`, `workerResultPacket`, `reviewPacket`, `verificationPacket`, and `evolutionWritebackPacket`.
- Require explicit dependency / parallel-group / merge-owner planning so independent work must parallelize instead of drifting into unnecessary serial execution.
- Tighten Review and Evolution rules so protocol compliance and owner coverage are reviewed, and durable learnings must write back into agents, skills, or workflow contracts.
- Sync both README files to the stronger canonical rules: pure-query bypass only, owner-first execution, protocol-first dispatch, explicit parallel planning, and Evolution writeback to capability assets.
- Add a workflow relation map to both README files so the real project paths are easier to distinguish: pure-query bypass, simple owner-driven shortcut, Type C 8-stage spine, 10-step governance upgrade, meta 3-phase flow, and Type D review flow.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Restore the two root README files to a more complete project-facing shape instead of the earlier over-compressed onboarding rewrite.
- Re-center the Chinese README on the `元` concept, preserving the original branding, concept explanation, contact block, support links, payment QR codes, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Bring `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` back into alignment with the current project design rather than leaving them as lighter onboarding-only summaries.
- Make the canonical governance sources explicit in documentation: `.claude/` plus `contracts/workflow-contract.json`.

### Added

- Canonical owner-first governance rules in `.claude/skills/meta-theory/references/dev-governance.md`: only pure `Q / Query` may bypass agents; every executable task must have an explicit owner.
- Explicit capability-gap resolution ladder: existing owner -> Type B owner creation/composition -> temporary `generalPurpose` owner with required justification and Evolution follow-up.
- Protocol-first dispatch requirements: `runHeader`, `dispatchBoard`, `workerTaskPacket`, `workerResultPacket`, `reviewPacket`, `verificationPacket`, and `evolutionWritebackPacket`.
- Parallelism requirements in the canonical sources: independent work must declare `dependsOn`, `parallelGroup`, and `mergeOwner` instead of defaulting to unnecessary serial execution.
- Evolution writeback rules that require each run to evaluate whether the current owner should be kept, adjusted, created, or retired.

### Synced

- Synced the strengthened canonical `meta-theory` skill and `dev-governance` reference into Codex mirrors, OpenClaw mirrors, shared skills, and workspace packs via `npm run sync:runtimes`.
- Synced the stronger owner-first / protocol-first / parallelism rules back into both public README files so outward-facing docs match the canonical project rules.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Rename private `meta/` directory to `docs/` and update all path references across 15+ files.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the current project state.
- Remove stale `factory/` references from public documentation.
- Add `contracts/` to the repository trees documented in the README files.
- Fix duplicate step numbering in `README.zh-CN.md`.
- Remove hardcoded global capability counts from `CLAUDE.md`.
- Add `.claude/capability-index/` to `.gitignore`.
- Sanitize local Windows paths in `docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md`.
