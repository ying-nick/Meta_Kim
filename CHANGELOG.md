## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-10

### Added

- Runtime-level `dispatchEnvelopePacket` governance for non-query runs, plus validator coverage for owner, capability boundary, memory mode, and review / verification ownership.
- Repo-local state layout under `.meta-kim/state/{profile}/`, including `run-index.sqlite`, local `compactionPacket` continuity state, and profile collision safeguards.
- Operator commands `index:runs`, `query:runs`, `rebuild:run-index`, and `migrate:meta-kim` for governed-run retrieval and staged migration from older prompt-pack / single-agent repos.

### Changed

- `discover:global` now rebuilds `.claude/capability-index/meta-kim-capabilities.json` first and keeps `global-capabilities.json` as a compatibility mirror.
- `doctor:governance` now reports layered health across canonical contracts, mirror parity, runtime hooks, and local profile / run-index state.
- Sync all runtime-facing governance docs to the new run-index / dispatch-envelope / compaction model, including `.claude/agents/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and all four README language variants.

### Fixed

- Fill the previously missing README updates in `README.ja-JP.md` and `README.ko-KR.md` so the multilingual docs now cover the new capability index, local run index, migration helper, and layered governance doctor flow.

## [1.2.3] - 2026-04-04

### Documentation

- **README (all four languages)**: remove `<div align="center">` wrappers around fenced Mermaid code blocks so **Cursor** (and similar previews) can render diagrams instead of **Unable to render rich display**; keep `div` centering for Markdown **tables** only. Repo-wide pass: `README.md` 9 blocks, `README.zh-CN.md` 9, `README.ja-JP.md` / `README.ko-KR.md` 8 each.

## [1.2.2] - 2026-04-03

### Documentation

- Align **README.ja-JP.md** and **README.ko-KR.md** with **README.md** / **README.zh-CN.md**: shared anchors (`#complex-spine-*`, `#meta-kim-diagram-two-layers-*`, `#task-routing-*`), workflow maps, runtime / eight-agent mini diagrams, and links to English canonical sections where detail stays in `README.md`.
- Fix **Mermaid** layout: `flowchart TB` with two horizontal `subgraph` blocks often renders **side-by-side**; replace with **stacked `flowchart LR`** pairs for the eight-stage spine (rows 1–4 / 5–8) and for spine vs 10-phase business workflow.
- Wrap Markdown **tables** in `<div align="center">` across all four READMEs so GitHub / VS Code previews center consistently (including stage tables with `Critical`, Hooks, Commands, etc.).
- **Repository structure**: replace ASCII tree with **path | description** tables in `README.md`, `README.ja-JP.md`, and `README.ko-KR.md` (match `README.zh-CN.md` granularity); add `codex/`, `docs/`, `shared-skills/`, `CHANGELOG.md` rows where missing.
- **JA/KO**: add the **two-layer workflow vocabulary** table (8-stage spine vs 10-phase business contract); add **`npx … meta-kim`** row to Quick Start usage tables; link abbreviated npm script lists to **`README.md#commands`** for the full command reference.
- Document **Meta_Kim** (`node setup.mjs`) as the canonical install path for **KimYx0207/findskill**; four README languages plus `CLAUDE.md` state that **in-repo naming uses `findskill` only** (aligned with `~/.claude/skills/findskill/`).
- **`npx` one-shot entry**: `npx github:KimYx0207/Meta_Kim meta-kim` documented as equivalent to `node setup.mjs` with per-locale `--check` examples.

### Added

- **Graphify** optional integration: compressed code knowledge graphs for target projects (subgraph extraction, up to ~71× token reduction), `graphify:*` npm scripts, Fetch-stage auto-detection hooks, README sections in all languages.

### Fixed

- Unify **findskill** naming across this repository: remove mixed **`find-skills`** wording in `meta-scout` / `meta-artisan` (`.claude`, `.codex`, OpenClaw SOUL), all `dev-governance` mirrors, and `docs/zh-CN/agents`, so prompts match the installed skill directory.
- Install **planning-with-files** from `skills/planning-with-files/` (sparse/subdir copy) in `install-deps.sh`, `setup.mjs`, and `install-global-skills-all-runtimes.mjs` so `~/.claude/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md` exists and Claude Code can load the skill and its frontmatter hooks. Whole-repo clone left SKILL only nested, so the skill was invisible.
- Install **findskill** from `windows/` on Windows and `original/` elsewhere (`KimYx0207/findskill` keeps no top-level `SKILL.md`). Same three install entrypoints updated.

### Changed

- Extend `contracts/workflow-contract.json` again to formalize card governance: `cardPlanPacket`, `cardDecision`, `deliveryShell`, `silenceDecision`, `controlDecision`, `summaryPacket`, explicit dealer ownership, and run-artifact validation policy.
- Add `scripts/validate-run-artifact.mjs` plus run-artifact fixtures/tests so Meta_Kim now validates real packet chains instead of only schema presence.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the new card/dealer/silence/summary/run-validator model; these doc changes now map to concrete contract and script additions instead of standalone wording.
- Align `package.json` with the latest released changelog version and stop public-facing docs from treating private/untracked `docs/meta.md` and `docs/repo-map.md` as required public entry points.
- Clarify in both README files that `docs/` is internal-only and remove any public requirement to read `docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md`.
- Harden `contracts/workflow-contract.json` from documentation-only governance toward runtime-checkable governance: add `taskClassification`, finding-level closure rules, explicit `writebackDecision`, and hard public-display gate semantics.
- Extend `scripts/validate-project.mjs` and `tests/meta-theory/07-contract-compliance.test.mjs` to enforce the new task-classification, finding-closure, evolution-decision, and runtime-parity requirements.
- Expand `docs/runtime-capability-matrix.md` with a behavior parity matrix covering trigger parity, hook parity, review parity, verification parity, stop condition parity, and writeback parity.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the hardened governance model so the public docs match the canonical runtime contract.
- Re-scope `eval:agents` into a lightweight no-LLM runtime smoke pass by default, and add `eval:agents:live` plus `verify:all:live` for explicit prompt-backed runtime acceptance.
- Harden `scripts/eval-meta-agents.mjs` with cross-platform process-tree cleanup, runtime filtering, and progress logging so interrupted or timed-out runtime checks do not leave orphaned child processes behind.
- Sync `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to the new smoke-vs-live evaluation split so maintenance guidance matches the actual scripts.
- Rewrite `README.zh-CN.md` into a newcomer-friendly Chinese guide with clearer quick start, runtime roles, maintenance flow, and FAQ.
- Rewrite `README.md` with matching English onboarding, clearer canonical-vs-derived asset guidance, and a simpler command reference.
- Expand both README files to restore key Meta_Kim design concepts: 8-stage spine vs. business workflow, hidden state skeleton, public-display gates, rollback protocol, and Evolution storage.
- Restore the original Mermaid flowcharts in both README files: method chain, 8-stage spine, iron-rules relation, and system flow.
- Rework `AGENTS.md` into a Codex-specific guide that keeps the dispatch-before-execution rule but removes cross-runtime ambiguity.
- Rework `CLAUDE.md` into a clearer Claude Code guide centered on canonical sources, hooks, and the sub-agent dispatch execution rule.
- Expand `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` to restore capability-first dispatch, workflow-contract layering, hidden skeleton, and display-gate discipline.
- Normalize explanations for `deps:install`, `discover:global`, `probe:clis`, `eval:agents`, and `verify:all`.
- Strengthen the canonical governance sources to make agent ownership explicit: only pure `Q / Query` may bypass agents, every executable task must have an owner, capability gaps now resolve through existing owner / Type B creation / temporary fallback owner.
- Add protocol-first dispatch requirements across the canonical sources: `runHeader`, `dispatchBoard`, `workerTaskPacket`, `workerResultPacket`, `reviewPacket`, `verificationPacket`, and `evolutionWritebackPacket`.
- Require explicit dependency / parallel-group / merge-owner planning so independent work must parallelize instead of drifting into unnecessary serial execution.
- Tighten Review and Evolution rules so protocol compliance and owner coverage are reviewed, and durable learnings must write back into agents, skills, or workflow contracts.
- Sync both README files to the stronger canonical rules: pure-query bypass only, owner-first execution, protocol-first dispatch, explicit parallel planning, and Evolution writeback to capability assets.
- Add a workflow relation map to both README files so the real project paths are easier to distinguish: pure-query bypass, simple owner-driven shortcut, Type C 8-stage spine, 10-step governance upgrade, meta 3-phase flow, and Type D review flow.
- Clarify the README concept layer in both languages: engineering is a governed domain of meta, but meta should orchestrate execution owners rather than pretending to be a single omnipotent engineer.
- Clarify the README architecture stance in both languages: Meta_Kim still keeps a chain-like spine, but now overlays it with hidden states, event controls, owner protocols, and parallel orchestration rather than remaining a pure linear flow.
- Move the “capability assets reduce repeated token cost over time” explanation into the early README sections in both languages so the long-term economic logic of the system is visible immediately.
- Harden the core method Mermaid diagram in both README files to use GitHub-friendly quoted labels, avoiding render failures around `Meta (元)` and other spaced node text.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-04-02

### Changed

- Restore the two root README files to a more complete project-facing shape instead of the earlier over-compressed onboarding rewrite.
- Re-center the Chinese README on the `元` concept, preserving the original branding, concept explanation, contact block, support links, payment QR codes, and Mermaid diagrams.
- Bring `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` back into alignment with the current project design rather than leaving them as lighter onboarding-only summaries.
- Make the canonical governance sources explicit in documentation: `.claude/` plus `contracts/workflow-contract.json`.

### Added

- Canonical owner-first governance rules in `.claude/skills/meta-theory/references/dev-governance.md`: only pure `Q / Query` may bypass agents; every executable task must have an explicit owner.
- Explicit capability-gap resolution ladder: existing owner -> Type B owner creation/composition -> temporary `generalPurpose` owner with required justification and Evolution follow-up.
- Protocol-first dispatch requirements: `runHeader`, `dispatchBoard`, `workerTaskPacket`, `workerResultPacket`, `reviewPacket`, `verificationPacket`, and `evolutionWritebackPacket`.
- Parallelism requirements in the canonical sources: independent work must declare `dependsOn`, `parallelGroup`, and `mergeOwner` instead of defaulting to unnecessary serial execution.
- Evolution writeback rules that require each run to evaluate whether the current owner should be kept, adjusted, created, or retired.

### Synced

- Synced the strengthened canonical `meta-theory` skill and `dev-governance` reference into Codex mirrors, OpenClaw mirrors, shared skills, and workspace packs via `npm run sync:runtimes`.
- Synced the stronger owner-first / protocol-first / parallelism rules back into both public README files so outward-facing docs match the canonical project rules.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Changed

- Rename private `meta/` directory to `docs/` and update all path references across 15+ files.
